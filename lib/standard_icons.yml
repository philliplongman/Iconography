# The standard 13th Age Icons
-
  name: The Archmage
  description: >
    The Archmage has preserved the Empire for centuries and created astonishing
    new lands. He has also threatened the fabric of reality with experiments
    you’d have to be brilliant or hugely arrogant to attempt.
-
  name: The Crusader
  description: >
    The Crusader is the armored fist of the Dark Gods. So long as followers of
    the Gods of Light stay the hell out of his way, the Crusader turns his wrath
    against the demons that would destroy the world his own gods want to rule.
    Follow the Crusader if you must win at any cost.
-
  name: The Diabolist
  description: >
    The Diabolist controls fiends and tampers with forces even the Archmage
    avoids. She likes her victims screaming and her chaos pure while claiming
    that the demons she summons would otherwise overwhelm the Great Gold Wyrm
    who seals the Abyss. There are two differences between her and her demons:
    First, she likes keeping destruction personal rather than universal. Second,
    she’s capable of kindness, so long as it comes as a great surprise.
-
  name: The Dwarf King
  description: >
    The Dwarf King is lord of Forge, the dwarves’ new homeland beneath the
    mountains. He’d love to reclaim the dwarven Underhome lost to war against
    the dark elves and the creatures of the deeps. But now that the Empire is
    stumbling, the dwarves find themselves manning the mountain walls that
    shield the Empire from the orcs and monsters of the north.
-
  name: The Elf Queen
  description: >
    The Elf Queen rules the Court of Stars, the one place where wood elves,
    dark elves, and high elves come together as peers and allies instead of as
    rivals or enemies. Honed by centuries of experience, the Queen’s innate
    magic at least equals the Archmage’s spells.
-
  name: The Emperor
  description: >
    The Emperor rules the world’s greatest human kingdom, known as the Dragon
    Empire for the mounts of its mightiest warriors. All the signs suggest that
    the age is turning, but will the Empire fall or shift to a new balance?
-
  name: The Great Gold Wyrm
  description: >
    The Great Gold Wyrm is the world’s protector and the inspiration for holy
    orders of paladins and independent heroes. Although the Gold Wyrm’s physical
    form seals the gap that prevents the Abyss from erupting into the world, his
    dreams and the agents he employs still move through the world, helping those
    who will fight and even die for what’s right.
-
  name: The High Druid
  description: >
    The High Druid is the champion of the resurgent Wild, and the spiritual and
    magical leader of spirits of nature and the elements that were chained by
    the Empire but are now working themselves free. She might be the great force
    that shakes the Empire to pieces or the hero who destroys the destroyers and
    points to a new way to live.
-
  name: The Lich King
  description: >
    The Lich King is the lord of the undead, a fallen tyrant who intends to
    conquer the Dragon Empire and restore his ancient kingdom. He’s not entirely
    insane and mostly understands that ruling a kingdom is not the same as
    destroying it.
-
  name: The Orc Lord
  description: >
    The Orc Lord is a figure of legend. The last time he walked the land the
    Lich King fell, in part because of the Orc Lord’s attack. Who will fall
    before his hordes this time? Who won’t?
-
  name: The Priestess
  description: >
    The Priestess hears all the Gods of Light and speaks for those who please
    her. She is part oracle, part mystic, and part metaphysical engineer, since
    she created the Cathedral, an ever-expanding temple with rooms or entire
    wings for each of the faiths she favors.
-
  name: The Prince of Shadows
  description: >
    The Prince of Shadows is part thief, part trickster, and part assassin. To
    some he is a hero; to others a villain. He has squandered the riches of the
    dwarves, murdered the hopes of a dragon, and plundered the dreams of a god.
    His exploits have changed the world, but none can tell you his ultimate
    goals or motives.
-
  name: The Three
  description: >
    The Three were among the first dragons to walk the world. The Red is a
    living engine of destruction. The Blue is a sorceress, perhaps even the
    original mother of all sorcery. The Black is queen of shadows and assassins.
    Unlike the Great Gold Wyrm, who must fight alone, the Three have learned to
    join forces.
