  name: The Archmage

  summary: >
    The Archmage has preserved the Empire for centuries and created
    astonishing new lands. He has also threatened the fabric of reality with
    experiments you’d have to be brilliant or hugely arrogant to attempt.

  quote: >
    “Your pardon, but this is the moment you burst into flames … fireball … and
    I go save civilization.”

  usual_location: >
    In Horizon, or (rumor has it) peering out through the eyes of one of his
    homunculi.

  common_knowledge: >
    For hundreds of years, one man has held the Empire together— the Archmage.
    While an everyday wizard works magic that can astound or destroy a crowd,
    the Archmage casts spells that make the civilized world safe and prosperous.
    His magic quiets storms, enlivens crops, and staves off plague. The Empire
    has experienced a steady growth in order, security, and wealth, largely
    because the Archmage wards off chaos, peril, and calamity.

    The Archmage’s plans and projects are beyond the ken of normal people, but
    even normal people are part of his schemes. The Empire’s farms plant
    different crops at different times, all coordinated by the Archmage’s
    schedule. Merchants and travelers consult the Archmage’s almanacs to find
    the best times to set sail. But the common people have little appreciation
    for what the Archmage does for them. People even complain about the
    Archmage’s instructions, as if he were a capricious bureaucrat in the
    imperial offices.

    The Archmage maintains the wards that protect the Empire through a series of
    magical nodes, placed at strategic points across the land. The nodes tap
    into ley lines, which occur naturally (although the imperial ley lines are
    better controlled and more powerful) and channel and direct arcane energy
    from them to the wards.

    The Archmage oversees the School of Imperial Wizardry, though it is run
    day-to-day by one of his trusted inner circle members. Sometimes this school
    devotes itself to testing and training those with arcane potential. The
    imperial wizards are notorious for being tight-lipped about their true
    intentions, and they lie without compunction to cover their tracks. No one
    holds it against them; the Archmage knows best.

  adventurers: >
    Many adventurers long to be hired into the Archmage’s service. His wizards
    provide powerful arcane support, and they reward adventurers well, but the
    Archmage’s missions are notoriously obscure. Instead of killing monsters or
    rescuing damsels, adventurers hired by imperial wizards may find themselves
    burying ritual items in wastelands or painting sigils on the walls of ruins.
    Somehow, it’s all very important to the empire.

    The less-known truth is that the Archmage is losing his handle on the
    multitude of tasks he has taken responsibility for and is forced to trust
    more and more missions to adventurers and agents while he struggles to deal
    with the high arcana that only he can survive.

  allies: >
    The Archmage swears undying fealty to the Emperor. There are legends of past
    Archmages who have betrayed their imperial oaths, and those legends always
    end poorly for all concerned. The Archmage and the Priestess, as fellow
    champions of the Empire, are bound to work together toward common goals.
    Some say that high-order goals are all the two icons have in common and that
    they are never seen together at Imperial functions. Others say that they
    cooperate more than anyone knows and that the Archmage even helped the
    Priestess build the Cathedral.

  enemies: >
    Nature, like the High Druid, chafes at the bit that the Archmage has jammed
    into its mouth. If the Archmage is the enemy of nature, he is careful not to
    raise the Elf Queen’s ire. The Archmage respects the boundaries of the Elf
    Queen’s territory, and for her part she has no particular sympathy for
    nature in the raw.

  history: >
    As often as not, no mortal is worthy to claim the title of Archmage. An
    Archmage’s reign lasts for decades or centuries. Eras in which there is an
    Archmage tend to be times of growth and recovery, though sometimes an
    Archmage appears in order to prevent the lands from descending into chaos.

    The current Archmage has been in power for centuries, overseeing a gradual
    increase in general security and prosperity.

  true_danger: >
    Everything will be all right provided that no catastrophe brings down the
    Archmage’s power nodes and plunges the Empire into a maelstrom of rampant
    elementals, natural forces, monsters from the Iron Sea, and demons from the
    Abyss.
