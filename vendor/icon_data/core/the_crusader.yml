  name: The Crusader

  summary: >
    The Crusader is the armored fist of the Dark Gods. So long as followers of
    the Gods of Light stay the hell out of his way, the Crusader turns his
    wrath against the demons that would destroy the world his own gods want to
    rule. Follow the Crusader if you must win at any cost.

    “I fear nothing, least of all doing what must be done.”

  usual_location: >
    First Triumph, a fortress in a conquered hellhole near Axis. Or out
    Crusading.

  common_knowledge: >
    One way or another, it’s a bad sign that the Crusader is accommodated within
    the Empire and sometimes even welcomed. It means either that the common
    people have lost their good sense or that times are so dire that the people
    will accept the help of a destroyer bound to the Dark Gods.

    If the enemy of your enemy is your friend, then the Crusader is everybody’s
    friend because demons are everybody’s enemy. The Crusader, however, is the
    sort of friend who will burn your house to the ground if he finds it
    tactically necessary.

    The mighty deeds of the Crusader include conquering hellholes and making
    them his own. The first hellhole he conquered was an especially large and
    perverted one near the Imperial capital, Axis. It was there that he
    established his headquarters, known as First Triumph. When he conquers a
    hellhole, he binds the defeated demons and forces them to garrison the fort
    he builds or claims at the location.

    The Crusader leads an elite corps of ruthless warriors, spellcasters, and
    assassins. From him, they learn the lost ways of the Dark Gods, speaking
    oaths long forbidden to those who walk in the light of day. Critics of the
    Crusader say that the side effect of this training is to burn all pity and
    love from the hearts of the crusaders, and indeed a pitiless heart is not a
    side effect but the very point of the training. Many crusader initiates
    prove unworthy of the challenge. Those who die in training are perhaps
    luckier than those who live on, forever haunted by what they learned but
    failed to master.

  adventurers: >
    For an adventurer to have undertaken missions sponsored by the Crusader is a
    cause for bragging rights. Such missions are never mere cakewalks or
    uneventful garrison duty. The Crusader has stepped on certain toes, and his
    personal style is unacceptable to certain hosts, so he occasionally hires
    adventurers from outside his organization to undertake missions in “hostile”
    territory, such as the Priestess’s Cathedral in Santa Cora or in the
    vicinity of the Golden Citadel.

  allies: >
    The Crusader acknowledges the Emperor as the ruler of the land, though some
    suspect that he would just as soon acknowledge the Lich King as such.

  enemies: >
    If the Diabolist fears the Crusader, and she probably should, then he’s the
    only thing in all the worlds that she fears. The Priestess works to protect
    people from the excesses of the Crusader, to the point of hindering his
    efforts. The bitter rivalry between the Crusader and the Great Gold Wyrm
    lacks any formal declaration, but it is as thick as ochre jelly.

  history: >
    The history books include accounts of imperial champions, but never a hero
    as dark and forbidding as the Crusader. He might be a new icon, or a
    recurrent hero icon that has somehow woke up on the dark side of the banner.

  true_danger: >
    Everything will be all right provided the demons keep the Crusader busy and
    he has no time to pay attention to second priorities, such as stomping on
    the face of goodness and light.
