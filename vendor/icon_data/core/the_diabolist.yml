  name: The Diabolist

  summary: >
    The Diabolist controls fiends and tampers with forces even the Archmage
    avoids. She likes her victims screaming and her chaos pure while claiming
    that the demons she summons would otherwise overwhelm the Great Gold Wyrm
    who seals the Abyss. There are two differences between her and her demons:
    First, she likes keeping destruction personal rather than universal.
    Second, she’s capable of kindness, so long as it comes as a great
    surprise.

  quote: >
    “Why do you mortals take these blood feuds so seriously? Don’t you see it’s
    all just a game? Don’t you realize that I’ve already won?”

  usual_location: >
    She is known to live in Hell Marsh, purportedly in a hellhole rife with
    ungodly flowers.

  common_knowledge: >
    The longer she lives, the more this Diabolist looks like one of her demons.
    The stories are that she was originally a human woman, but you’d be
    hard-pressed to prove it.

    If the Diabolist has overarching goals, they are obscure. What’s clear is
    the delight she takes in wielding power and unleashing chaos. Her enemies
    say that she may be nothing more than a slave to the vast powers she dares
    to command, but as long as she’s smiling she seems to have the upper hand.

    The Diabolist leads a scattered and half-mad crew of fiendish cultists. They
    adore her with respect that borders on worship. In turn, she alternately
    exalts them and brings them to ruin. With her help, they learn occult
    secrets, master unspeakable magic, and gloat over the destruction of their
    enemies. No cultist knows the extent of the cult or its ultimate goals. It
    is certainly more widespread than the imperial authorities admit to
    publicly.

    The Diabolist lacks the focus and discipline that define the Crusader. She
    is in it for herself, and she indulges even her petty whims. If she remained
    on-task the way the Crusader does, things would doubtless be a lot worse.
    Unless indulging her whims is actually part of a subtle plot that none can
    guess at until it is too late.

  adventurers: >
    Too many adventurers accept missions on the Diabolist’s behalf, often
    because they are reckless. If adventurers knew what was best for them, they
    would probably have chosen safer careers than adventuring. Still, a few
    lucky adventurers have profited mightily from her sponsorship, and they love
    to show off the remarkable weapons and talismans that they have acquired in
    consideration for their services.

    Adventurers who work for the Diabolist for long suspect that her chaotic
    whims and petty vendettas are cover for howling insanity. There are ranks of
    fiendish cultists hidden behind the gloating cultists who are easy to spot
    and kill. The deeper you go the more disturbing and insane the experience
    becomes.

  allies: >
    The Diabolist and the Prince of Shadows are said to work together. Everyone
    else hopes they’re going to betray each other. They hope that a lot.

  enemies: >
    The Crusader is the Diabolist’s worst nightmare, and she’s no big fan of the
    Great Gold Wyrm, either. The Priestess protects good people from corruption,
    making her a real annoyance.

  history: >
    It seems there’s always a Diabolist or at least someone who claims the
    title. Each of these twisted villains has been different from the ones that
    came before them. Embracing chaos amplifies a mortal’s personal traits,
    making each Diabolist unique. Usually a Diabolist is something of a rumor
    and a mystery, more a legend than a force to be reckoned with.
    Unfortunately, the current Diabolist has proven herself to be much more than
    a story to frighten children with.

  true_danger: >
    Everything will be all right provided that the Diabolist remains unable to
    corrupt the Emperor or other icons.
