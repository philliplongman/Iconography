  name: The Dwarf King
  blurb: >
    The Dwarf King is lord of Forge, the dwarves’ new homeland beneath the
    mountains. He’d love to reclaim the dwarven Underhome lost to war against
    the dark elves and the creatures of the deeps. But now that the Empire is
    stumbling, the dwarves find themselves manning the mountain walls that
    shield the Empire from the orcs and monsters of the north.
