  name: The Dwarf King

  summary: >
    The Dwarf King is lord of Forge, the dwarves’ new homeland beneath the
    mountains. He’d love to reclaim the dwarven Underhome lost to war against
    the dark elves and the creatures of the deeps. But now that the Empire is
    stumbling, the dwarves find themselves manning the mountain walls that
    shield the Empire from the orcs and monsters of the north.

  quote: >
    In the name of the Ancestors of Adamant, I accept the return of these
    stolen dwarf treasures.

  usual_location: >
    Forge, the dwarves’ underground throne city. In rare circumstances he’s been
    reported seen outside the city.

  common_knowledge: >
    The Dwarf King is the master of treasures, pressing a claim on all marvels
    pulled from the earth. His halls are filled with legendary marvels. As the
    Emperor rules the civilized lands above, the Dwarf King rules the civilized
    lands below.

  adventurers: >
    The Dwarf King has the means and the cause to hire mercenaries to represent
    his interests or retrieve items that the dwarves lay claim to, whether on
    the surface world or deep underground.

  allies: >
    The Dwarf King works reliably with the Emperor, and he respects the ages-old
    truce with the Elf Queen.

  enemies: >
    When the Elf Queen’s dark elves get out of hand, they are the worst sort of
    enemy. The Dwarf King has offered a king’s ransom for the head of the Prince
    of Shadows.

  history: >
    There is always a Dwarf King. This one has been in place for centuries, and
    no one would be surprised if he decided to end his reign fighting on the
    battlefield.

  true_danger: >
    Everything will be all right provided the Dwarf King does not unseal the
    Hall of Vengeance and retrieve the legendary Axe of Seven Bloods.
