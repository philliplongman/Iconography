  name: The Elf Queen

  summary: >
    The Elf Queen rules the Court of Stars, the one place where wood elves,
    dark elves, and high elves come together as peers and allies instead of as
    rivals or enemies. Honed by centuries of experience, the Queen’s innate
    magic at least equals the Archmage’s spells.

  quote: >
    We accept your most gracious offer of an invitation, my dear cousin.

  usual_location: >
    In the Court in Queen’s Wood, north of Drakkenhall and Concord.

  common_knowledge: >
    The Queen is mystically connected to every elf, and so every elf is
    mystically connected to every other elf.

  adventurers: >
    Elf adventurers consider it an honor to work for the Queen, and non-elf
    adventurers consider it something of a miracle. Elf adventurers may find
    themselves guided by the Queen’s dream sendings to join the perilous
    adventures of other elves who need their help.

  allies: >
    The High Druid is figuratively her half-sister of the woods. The blood truce
    with the Dwarf King has created a long and prosperous peace, but the truce
    is technically temporary. The Emperor is a trusted ally, but the Emperor’s
    Priestess and Archmage can be wearisome.

  enemies: >
    The Orc Lord is the elves’ shame because they created the original. It may
    fall to the Queen to dispatch him. The Dwarf King should be her mortal
    enemy, but an ages- old truce has preserved the peace. The Three resent the
    Queen for imprisoning the Green.

  history: >
    There is always an Elf King or Queen, though sometimes they are hidden and
    unknown. The current Queen has ruled for most of the current age.

  true_danger: >
    Everything will be all right so long as the dark elves remain out of favor
    in the Court, so that the Elf Queen sees little reason to exact bloody
    vengeances for ancient slights remembered only by the elves.
