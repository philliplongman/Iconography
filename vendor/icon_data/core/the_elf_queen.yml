  name: The Elf Queen
  blurb: >
    The Elf Queen rules the Court of Stars, the one place where wood elves,
    dark elves, and high elves come together as peers and allies instead of as
    rivals or enemies. Honed by centuries of experience, the Queen’s innate
    magic at least equals the Archmage’s spells.
