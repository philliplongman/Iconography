the_emperor:
  name: The Emperor

  summary: >
    The Emperor rules the worldâ€™s greatest human kingdom, known as the Dragon
    Empire for the mounts of its mightiest warriors. All the signs suggest
    that the age is turning, but will the Empire fall or shift to a new
    balance?

  quote: >
    As long as I draw breath, the Empire is safe.

  usual_location: >
    Axis, the capital of the Dragon Empire.

  common_knowledge: >
    The Dragon Emperor hails from a long line of noble rulers. It is his nature
    to lead. To the civilized people, he is the champion of their safety and
    prosperity.

  adventurers: >
    Adventurers are routinely hired by imperial functionaries to carry out all
    manner of ad hoc missions. Adventurers who work exclusively for the Emperor
    are rewarded with increased pay and greater status, though other adventurers
    are likely to label them as imperial functionaries.

  allies: >
    The Archmage and Priestess work closely with the Emperor. The Crusader and
    Great Gold Wyrm ostensibly are duty-bound to the Emperor, but they interpret
    that duty as they each see fit. The Dwarf King and Elf Queen are united with
    the Emperor in pursuit of peace and security.

  enemies: >
    The Lich King explicitly claims continued authority over the Empire, a
    treasure he seeks to reclaim from the Dragon Emperors. The Orc Lord seems
    destined to face the Emperor, as the previous Orc Lord faced the Wizard
    King.

  history: >
    Ever since the first Dragon Emperor established the Imperial Seal, there has
    always been a Dragon Emperor. Elaborate and exacting ceremonies ensure that
    the power and authority of the original Emperor live on. The current Emperor
    is capable but essentially unproven.

  true_danger: >
    Everything will be all right as long as the Emperor stands stalwart between
    civilization and chaos.
