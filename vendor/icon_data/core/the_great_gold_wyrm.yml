  name: The Great Gold Wyrm

  summary: >
    The Great Gold Wyrm is the world’s protector and the inspiration for holy
    orders of paladins and independent heroes. Although the Gold Wyrm’s
    physical form seals the gap that prevents the Abyss from erupting into the
    world, his dreams and the agents he employs still move through the world,
    helping those who will fight and even die for what’s right.

    If you fail me now, then my own sacrifice is also futile.

  usual_location: >
    Centuries ago, the Great Gold Wyrm threw itself into the Abyss to prevent
    the demons of hell from pouring out into the world. The Wyrm’s physical
    presence and his magical wards are still all that prevents the Abyss from
    ripping the world wide open.

    Most often the Wyrm remains stationary near the worst of the tears in
    reality, other times he rampages through a portion of the Abyss slaying
    demons that have caught his eye. Paladins say that if true heroes can find a
    way to stop the gap, even for a night and a day, the Great Gold Wyrm would
    be free to reinvigorate his followers, restore the Golden Citadel, and beat
    back the Three.

  common_knowledge: >
    The best and bravest hear the Great Gold Wyrm’s call or receive his visions.
    They enter into his service as an elite champion, usually but not always as
    a member of the Golden Order.

  adventurers: >
    Various orders of paladins and clerics draw inspiration and power from the
    Great Gold Wyrm, as do mystically chosen individual heroes. In turn, these
    orders have been known to hire adventuring bands for special purposes.

  allies: >
    The Golden Order serves the Dragon Empire and its Emperor, albeit at their
    own discretion.

  enemies: >
    The Wyrm’s principal enemies are the Diabolist and the Three. Both conflicts
    have mythical overtones, and like all true myths, there are moments when the
    great enemies have worked together, such as when the Red Dragon eliminated
    the demons that had escaped the Abyss, an act of violence that created the
    Red Wastes.

  history: >
    There has only ever been one Great Gold Wyrm, from the days when the gods
    made all the worlds to this very day. And some would say that there’s not
    much of the Great Gold Wyrm left.

  true_danger: >
    Everything will be all right unless the Great Gold Wyrm finally loses his
    battle and the Abyss opens to swallow the world.
