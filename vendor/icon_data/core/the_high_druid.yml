  name: The High Druid

  summary: >
    The High Druid is the champion of the resurgent Wild, and the spiritual
    and magical leader of spirits of nature and the elements that were chained
    by the Empire but are now working themselves free. She might be the great
    force that shakes the Empire to pieces or the hero who destroys the
    destroyers and points to a new way to live.

  quote: >
    There’s a place for your roads and your cities: hunched tight to the shores
    of that fangless thing you still call a sea.

  usual_location: >
    For the first time in ages, the High Druid has established her environs
    within the bounds of the Empire, in the Wild Wood near New Port and Santa
    Cora.

  common_knowledge: >
    The High Druid conducts sacred rituals from the age before the gods or the
    worlds. With these rituals, she calls up the mighty powers of nature. Druids
    everywhere, in turn, gain this power through allegiance to her.

    It has been a long time since there was a High Druid who lived anywhere near
    the Empire. So far as anyone knows, the Druids have been strongest far to
    the North. But this new High Druid, a young half-elf woman, was born in the
    Empire and has turned the Wild Wood into her place of power. Her influence
    is being felt in all the other wild spaces, with effects ranging from
    increased growth of impassable forest to vastly increased amounts of game in
    the forests, schools of fish in the Midland Sea, and flocks of birds
    migrating across the land. Even Imperial officers admit that the High
    Druid’s influence seems to make the Empire’s lands in the region around Wild
    Wood healthier. Of course, they are also rightly concerned that it’s a
    region that would not mind shaking off the Empire’s cities, farms, and
    crowns.

  adventurers: >
    Many rangers and druids have a relationship, one way or the other, with the
    High Druid. The High Druid herself may or may not be sending agents into the
    field. Certainly various high-power druids who respect the High Druid are
    using resurgence in wild power to pursue their own conflicting agendas. Some
    of these powerful druids have hired adventurers, and others have responded
    by hiring adventurers to destroy their rivals’ hirelings.

  allies: >
    The High Druid is a force unto herself. She is figuratively half-sister of
    the Elf Queen, but there’s more sibling rivalry than love.

  enemies: >
    The High Druid challenges the Emperor’s authority in the territory she has
    colonized. The Archmage has been restraining the tempestuous forces of
    nature to protect civilization, and the High Druid can feel it in her bones.

  history: >
    There usually is a High Druid. Sometimes there are two, but not for long.
    The High Druid’s affairs mostly concern the wilds, and civilized people know
    little about them.

  true_danger: >
    Everything will be all right unless the Emperor and the High Druid truly go
    to war.
