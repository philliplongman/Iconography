  name: The Lich King

  summary: >
    The Lich King is the lord of the undead, a fallen tyrant who intends to
    conquer the Dragon Empire and restore his ancient kingdom. He’s not
    entirely insane and mostly understands that ruling a kingdom is not the
    same as destroying it.

    “All may hate me, but none may deny me.”

  usual_location: >
    In the Necropolis, an island in the Midland Sea near Omen Island. Or
    teleporting into most any other ruin in “his” realm.

  common_knowledge: >
    During the day, the Empire is a land of light and song. But at night, it is
    easy to look out one’s window at the moon-touched land and see that it very
    nearly still belongs to the Lich King.

    Ages ago, the Lich King was the Wizard King, and he ruled all the lands with
    magic and tyranny. The first Dragon Emperor, the elves, and the dwarves
    joined forces to defeat him. Ages later, however, the Wizard King returned
    as the undying Lich King.

    The Lich King commands all undead, to some extent. His power grows when
    sacrifices to the dead are not maintained and graveyards are desecrated, but
    even when all rites are properly observed he schemes, betrays, and attacks.

    “By the fist of the lich” is a common macho curse. The magic hand the Lich
    King wears to replace his missing hand is a fearsome artifact in its own
    right. Those who would rather not call the Lich King by name refer to him as
    the One-Eyed King.

  adventurers: >
    Evil clerics gain power through the Lich King. Wanted criminals have
    sometimes given their lives to the Lich King rather than to justice.

  allies: >
    Who would betray life and ally with death?

  enemies: >
    The Priestess, the Orc Lord, the Elf Queen, the Dwarf King, the Three, the
    Great Gold Wyrm, and everyone else.

  history: >
    There has only ever been one Lich King, the former Wizard King of an earlier
    age.

  true_danger: >
    As long as the graveyards are maintained and the imperial rituals repeated,
    the Lich King will never retake his throne.
