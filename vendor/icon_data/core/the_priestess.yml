  name: The Priestess
  blurb: >
    The Priestess hears all the Gods of Light and speaks for those who please
    her. She is part oracle, part mystic, and part metaphysical engineer,
    since she created the Cathedral, an ever-expanding temple with rooms or
    entire wings for each of the faiths she favors.
