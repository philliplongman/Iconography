  name: The Prince of Shadows

  summary: >
    The Prince of Shadows is part thief, part trickster, and part assassin. To
    some he is a hero; to others a villain. He has squandered the riches of
    the dwarves, murdered the hopes of a dragon, and plundered the dreams of a
    god. His exploits have changed the world, but none can tell you his
    ultimate goals or motives.

  quote: >
    ”Don’t bother thanking me, I already thanked myself to your gold and your
    lover’s heart.”

  usual_location: >
    Shadow Port, or anywhere else he cares to be.

  common_knowledge: >
    Not everyone believes there is a Prince of Shadows. This works out extremely
    well for the Prince. He doesn’t care about getting credit for his exploits.
    Consequently, there are places where he’s blamed for every major theft, and
    other places where he’s viewed as an invention of the Thieves’ Guilds to
    cover their tracks.

  adventurers: >
    Adventurers sometimes work for the Prince of Shadows without ever knowing
    it. In some sense, anyone who accepts one of his gifts is doing the Prince’s
    work. Other adventurers like the Prince’s style and aim to further his
    schemes, but that’s a shifty path and what works for an icon can often as
    not walk an adventurer into a wall of swords.

  allies: >
    The Diabolist has profited from certain of the Prince’s “transactions,” but
    the Priestess, at least, believes that the Prince stole more from the
    Diabolist than the Diabolist suspects. Who can say?

  enemies: >
    The Dwarf King has offered a king’s-ransom in platinum for the Prince of
    Shadows’ head, but no one knows why. The Archmage has tried to retrieve
    certain stolen artifacts from the Prince, but hasn’t claimed success in the
    endeavor.

  history: >
    Shadowy figures appear on the margins of official histories. Some of these
    mysterious figures are previous incarnations of the Prince of Shadows in
    other guises with other names.

  true_danger: >
    If the Prince of Shadows ever ends up leading the forces of evil, it’s going
    to be bad news.
