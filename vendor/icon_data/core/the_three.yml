  name: The Three
  blurb: >
    The Three were among the first dragons to walk the world. The Red is a
    living engine of destruction. The Blue is a sorceress, perhaps even the
    original mother of all sorcery. The Black is queen of shadows and
    assassins. Unlike the Great Gold Wyrm, who must fight alone, the Three
    have learned to join forces.
